shortcuts
=========

I use xbindkeys and some helper scripts to make life easier.

Here is my config file, and helper scripts to go along with them.

My main laptop is an x220, and I use the Logitech g9x mouse.

Place the xbindkeysrc file in ~/.xbindkeysrc, and modify as desired.

This currently allows me to:

1) Flip between KDE desktops with the side mouse buttons
2) Toggle Expose and Expose All using the mouse wheel side-to-side motion
3) Launch chrome with Alt-Side Button Down
4) Launch konsole with Alt-Side Button Up
5) Show Desktop with Ctrl-Side Button Down
6) Use the Mic Mute button on the laptop to mute/unmute my mic,
   along with desktop notication (this use the pa-mic-mute-toggle.sh script)
